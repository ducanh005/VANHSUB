# Draft review description — VANHSUB Release Candidate stabilization

Target:main. Head:codex/integration-stabilization-20261015. Suggested state:Draft. **Do not merge/release yet.**

This branch safely reconciles all 27 remote commits with selected audit/local fixes, preserving owner workspaces, snapshots/revisions, task leases and artifact invalidation. RC changes add protocol 2 mutual extension/server pairing (nonce/port/Origin-bound HMAC, DPAPI key storage), revocation and socket response binding, bounded IPC payloads, local file grants, verified current-secret migration, bundled extension resources, editor pagination and TTS cancellation/last-good-output preservation. Electron/Next were patched with a bounded lockfile update; the unused JS Whisper wrapper is build-only and absent from the shipped archive.

Validation:full clean-dependency production/NSIS build, main/renderer typechecks,45 offline/loopback suites, actual packaged UI/security/persistence checks, native ASR/export, controlled local HTTP close/reset/timeout/checkpoint/concurrency, Unicode paths and corrected actual-main SIGKILL/restart. Scope and resource measurements:docs/CODEX_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_ACCEPTANCE.md.

Blocking acceptance:clean Windows installation/VM, signing, live Flow/provider pipelines, all-job crash/recovery and multi-hour stress. Full toolchain audit still has8 High/8 Moderate despite production scan0. No clean-install or provider-live PASS is claimed.
